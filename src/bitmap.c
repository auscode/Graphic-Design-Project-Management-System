This function adds a new project to an array of projects, given the project's name, duration, type, status, client name, and client email. 
It first checks if a project with the same name already exists in the array, and if so, returns 0 indicating failure to add the project. 
If the project doesn't exist in the array, a new client and project are created with the given information, added to the array, 
and the number of projects is incremented. The function then returns 1 indicating success in adding the project.
